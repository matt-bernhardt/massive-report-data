		<p>This is a repository for data concerning the Columbus Crew - its history and its context. I analyze and visualize a wide variety of information in order to help fans of the team to understand its performance.</p>
		<p>This site launched in late 2012; it is still being built, so I invite you to take a look around, and let me know if there is something I've overlooked or gotten wrong. My email address is at the bottom of every page.</p>

			<h2><a href="/visualize/roster">Charting Player Sizes By Team</a></h2>
			<p>April 27<br>
			Inspired by a series of charts on NHL player sizes that I saw recently, here is a quick visualization of player sizes - height and weight - by team, position, and playing time.</p>

			<h2><a href="/browse/opponents">All-time Opponents</a></h2>
			<p>August 13<br>
			This update was actually posted some time ago, but the navigation changes needed to expose it haven't happened yet. This is a list of all opponents that the Crew have faced in official competitions. Can't remember if the Crew ever played a team from Syracuse (<a href="/opponent/121">yes, they have</a>)? This is your answer.</p>

			<h2><a href="/visualize/combinations">Player Combinations</a></h2>
			<p>July 14<br>
			I'm happy to release an exploration tool for player combinations. This project allows people to explore how the Crew's performance has changed as different combinations of players have changed.</p>
