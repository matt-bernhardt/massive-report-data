		<h1>Welcome to Massive Report Data!</h1>
		<p>This is a repository for data concerning the Columbus Crew - its history and its context. I analyze and visualize a wide variety of information in order to help fans of the team to understand its performance.</p>
		<p>This site launched in late 2012; it is still being built, so I invite you to take a look around, and let me know if there is something I've overlooked or gotten wrong. My email address is at the bottom of every page.</p>
