In the 16 year history of the stadium, crowd sizes have ranged between 10 and 25 thousand. The low point was 2011, while the high was unsurprisingly set in the stadium\'s first year.</p>';

	$longPageContent .= '<p>Attendance shows some correlation with game day temperature, as depicted above. This is not surprising, although the math - an R<sup>2</sup> value of 0.3264 - indicates that temperature alone does not explain the variation. It appears that attendance varies by about 163 people for every degree of temperature gained or lost.</p>';
	$longPageContent .= '<p>Other possible factors that could influence attendance include precipitation, opponent, competitive prospects, and the sales efforts by the front office. This last factor is particularly important, as shown by <a href="http://www.examiner.com/article/columbus-crew-seek-to-build-on-two-years-of-attendance-growth-2014">the attendance growth since 2011</a> after the team restructured their sales team.</p>';
