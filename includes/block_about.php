Massive Report is dedicated to providing the highest quality coverage of the Columbus Crew. This site is not intended to provide information about current events or the latest games; fans are encouraged to visit the parent site for timely coverage of the Crew and Major League Soccer.</p>";
	$longPageContent .= "<p>This site is designed and curated by Matthew Bernhardt, statistician and historian for Massive Report. It is built upon a database of information covering the entire history of the Columbus Crew, from their first game on April 13, 1996 through the present day.</p>";
	$longPageContent .= "<p>Beyond the simple facts, this site also attempts to analyze trends lying within the numbers. There are a great number of companies that perform similar analyses, and do so very well. This site follows a different strategy by considering only a minimum of source information: players, games, substitutions, and goals. Even from this limited data, however, it is possible to learn a great deal.</p>";
	$longPageContent .= "<p>To illustrate these conclusions, and facilitate research by others, this site provides a variety of tools to visualize the source data. Drawing from a number of javascript libraries, visitors can see information displayed in a number of formats, with more being added on a regular basis.</p>";

	$longPageContent .= "<p>This site is delivered in HTML5 format, with extensive use of CSS styling and a number of Javascript libraries. Credit is given for each library on the page on which it is used. I am particularly in the debt of Mike Bostock, author of the Protovis and D3 libraries, whose discovery started me on the path that led to the creation of this site.</p>";
